# iterm-theme
My theme from iTerm transposed into JSON<br><br>

I named the profile Linux-like because it reminds me of Linux terminal layouts.<br>
The profile also requires neofetch which can be installed with [``neofetch.sh``](https://github.com/phoebe-leong/iterm-theme/blob/main/neofetch.sh) (yes it has to be installed into the specific directory given).
